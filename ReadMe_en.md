# SmartDNS

![SmartDNS](doc/smartdns-banner.png)  
SmartDNS is a local DNS server. SmartDNS accepts DNS query requests from local clients, obtains DNS query results from multiple upstream DNS servers, and returns the fastest access results to clients. supports secure DNS protocols like DoT (DNS over TLS), DoH (DNS over HTTPS), better protect privacy,  
Avoiding DNS pollution and improving network access speed, supports high-performance ad filtering.  
Unlike dnsmasq's all-servers, smartdns returns the fastest access resolution. （[read more](#faq)）

## Architecture

![Architecture](doc/architecture.png)

1. SmartDNS receives DNS query requests from local network devices, such as PCs and mobile phone query requests.
2. SmartDNS sends query requests to multiple upstream DNS servers, using standard UDP queries, non-standard port UDP queries, and TCP queries.
3. The upstream DNS server returns a list of Server IP addresses corresponding to the domain name. SmartDNS detects the fastest Server IP with local network access.
4. Return the fastest accessed Server IP to the local client.

    ```
    **For Ubuntu system:**
    * `systemd-resolved` occupies TCP53 and UDP53 ports. You need to manually resolve the port occupancy problem or modify the SmartDNS listening port

    * Log files in `/var/log/smartdns/smartdns.log`

1. Configuration

    After the installation is complete, you can configure the upstream server to  smartdns. Refer to the `Configuration Parameters` for specific configuration parameters.  
    In general, you only need to add `server [IP]:port`, `server-tcp [IP]:port` configuration items.  
    Configure as many upstream DNS servers as possible, including servers at home and abroad. Please refer to the `Configuration Parameters` section for configuration parameters.  

    ```shell
    vi /etc/smartdns/smartdns.conf
    ```

    `smartdns.conf` example:
    ```
    # set listen port
    bind []:53 
    # set upstream servers
    server 1.1.1.1
    server-tls 8.8.8.8
    # set domain rules
    address /example.com/1.2.3.4
    domain-rule /example.com/ -address 1.2.3.4
    ```

1. Start Service

    ```shell
    systemctl enable smartdns
    systemctl start smartdns
    ```

1. Forwarding DNS request to SmartDNS

    Modify the DNS server of the local router and configure the DNS server as SmartDNS.
    * Log in to the router on the local network and configure the Raspberry Pi to assign a static IP address.
    * Modify the WAN port or DHCP DNS to the Raspberry Pi IP address.
    Note:
    I. Each router configuration method is different. Please search Baidu for related configuration methods.
    II. some routers may not support configuring custom DNS server. in this case, please modify the PC's, mobile phone's DNS server to the ip of Raspberry Pi.

1. Check if the service is configured successfully

    Query domain name with `nslookup -querytype=ptr smartdns`  
    Check if the `name` item in the command result is displayed as `smartdns` or `hostname`, such as `smartdns`

    ```shell
    pi@raspberrypi:~/code/smartdns_build $ nslookup -querytype=ptr smartdns
    Server:         192.168.1.1
    Address:        192.168.1.1#53

    Non-authoritative answer:
    smartdns         name = smartdns.
    ```

### openwrt

--------------

1. Installation

    Upload the software to the /root directory of the router with winscp or other tool, and execute the following command to install it.

    ```shell
    opkg install smartdns.xxxxxxxx.xxxx.ipk
    opkg install luci-app-smartdns.xxxxxxxx.xxxx.all.ipk
    ```

    * Note: For versions before openwrt 19.07, please install `luci-app-smartdns.xxxxxxxxx.all-luci-compat-all` package.

1. Configuration

    Log in to the openwrt management page and open `Services`->`SmartDNS` to configure SmartDNS.
    * Add upstream DNS server configuration to `Upstream Servers`. It is recommended to configure multiple DNS servers at home and abroad.
    * Specify the IP address of a specific domain name in `Domain Address`, which can be used for ad blocking.

1. Start Service

   There are two ways to use the SmartDNS service, `one is directly as the primary DNS service`, `the other is as the upstream of dnsmasq`.  
   By default, SmartDNS uses the first method. You can choose according to your needs in the following two ways.

1. Method 1: SmartDNS as primary DNS Server 

    * **Enable SmartDNS as primary DNS Server**

        Log in to the router, click on `Services`->`SmartDNS`->`port`, input port `53`, smartdns will run as primary DNS Server.

    * **Check if the service is configured successfully**

        Query domain name with `nslookup -querytype=ptr smartdns`
        See if the `name` item in the command result is displayed as `smartdns` or `hostname`, such as `smartdns`

        ```shell
        pi@raspberrypi:~/code/smartdns_build $ nslookup -querytype=ptr smartdns
        Server:         192.168.1.1
        Address:        192.168.1.1#53

        Non-authoritative answer:
        smartdns         name = smartdns.
        ```

1. Start Service

    Check the `Enable' in the configuration page to start SmartDNS server.

1. Note

   * When the port of smartdns is 53, it will automatically take over dnsmasq as the primary dns. When configuring other ports, dnsmasq is re-enabled as primary dns.
   * If an exception occurs during this process, you can use the following command to restore dnsmasq as the primary DNS

   ```shell
   uci delete dhcp.@dnsmasq[0].port
   uci commit dhcp
   /etc/init.d/dnsmasq restart
   ```

### ASUS router native firmware / Merlin firmware

--------------

Note: Merlin firmware is derived from ASUS firmware and can theoretically be used directly with the ASUS package. However, it is currently unverified. If you have any questions, please submit an issue.

1. Prepare

    When using this software, you need to confirm whether the router supports U disk and prepare a USB disk.

1. Enable SSH login

    Log in to the management interface, click `System Management`-> Click `System Settings` and configure `Enable SSH` to `Lan Only`.  
    The SSH login username and password are the same as the management interface.

1. Insstall `Download Master`

    In the management interface, click `USB related application`-> click `Download Master` to download.  
    After the download is complete, enable `Download Master`. If you do not need the download function, you can uninstall `Download Master` here, but make sure that Download Master is enabled before uninstalling.  

1. Install SmartDNS

    Upload the software to the router's `/tmp/mnt/sda1` directory using winscp. (or copy the network neighborhood to the sda1 shared directory)

    ```shell
    ipkg install smartdns.xxxxxxx.mipsbig.ipk
    ```

1. Restart router

    After the router is started, use `nslookup -querytype=ptr smartdns` to query the domain name.  
    See if the `name` item in the command result is displayed as `smartdns` or `hostname`, such as `smartdns`

    ```shell
    pi@raspberrypi:~/code/smartdns_build $ nslookup -querytype=ptr smartdns
    Server:         192.168.1.1
    Address:        192.168.1.1#53

    Non-authoritative answer:
    smartdns         name = smartdns.
    ```

1. Note

    In the above process, smartdns will be installed to the root directory of the U disk and run in optware mode.  
    Its directory structure is as follows: (only smartdns related files are listed here)

    ```shell
    USB DISK
    └── asusware.mipsbig
            ├── bin
            ├── etc
            |    ├── smartdns
            |    |     └── smartdns.conf
            |    └── init.d
            |          └── S50smartdns
            ├── lib
            ├── sbin
            ├── usr
            |    └── sbin
            |          └── smartdns
            ....
    ```

    To modify the configuration, you can use ssh to login to the router and use the vi command to modify it.

    ```shell
    vi /opt/etc/smartdns/smartdns.conf
    ```
    
    `smartdns.conf` example:
    ```
    # set listen port
    bind []:53 
    # set upstream servers
    server 1.1.1.1
    server-tls 8.8.8.8
    # set domain rules
    address /example.com/1.2.3.4
    domain-rule /example.com/ -address 1.2.3.4
    ```

    It can also be modified from Network Neighborhood. From the neighbor sharing directory `sda1` you can't see the `asusware.mipsbig` directory, but you can directly enter `asusware.mipsbig\etc\init.d` in `File Manager` to modify it.

    ```shell
    \\192.168.1.1\sda1\asusware.mipsbig\etc\init.d
    ```

### optware/entware

--------------

1. Prepare

    When using this software, you need to confirm whether the router supports USB disk and prepare a USB disk.

1. Install SmartDNS

    Upload the software to `/tmp` directory of the router using winscp, and run the flollowing command to install.

    ```shell
    ipkg install smartdns.xxxxxxx.mipsbig.ipk
    ```

1. Modify the smartdns configuration

    ```shell
    Vi /opt/etc/smartdns/smartdns.conf
    ```

    `smartdns.conf` example:
    ```
    # set listen port
    bind []:53 
    # set upstream servers
    server 1.1.1.1
    server-tls 8.8.8.8
    # set domain rules
    address /example.com/1.2.3.4
    domain-rule /example.com/ -address 1.2.3.4
    ```

    Note: if you need to support IPV6, you can set the worke-mode to `2`, this will disable the DNS service of dnsmasq, and smartdns run as the primary DNS server. Change `SMARTDNS_WORKMODE` in the file `/opt/etc/smartdns/smartdns-opt.conf` to 2.

    ```shell
    SMARTDNS_WORKMODE="2"
    ```

1. Restart the router to take effect

    After the router is started, use `nslookup -querytype=ptr smartdns` to query the domain name.
    See if the `name` item in the command result is displayed as `smartdns` or `hostname`, such as `smartdns`

    ```shell
    Pi@raspberrypi:~/code/smartdns_build $ nslookup -querytype=ptr smartdns
    Server: 192.168.1.1
    Address: 192.168.1.1#53

    Non-authoritative answer:
    smartdns        name = smartdns.
    ```

    Note: If the service does not start automatically, you need to set optwre/entware to start automatically. For details, see the optware/entware documentation.

## FAQ

1. What is the difference between SmartDNS and DNSMASQ?  
    Smartdns is not designed to replace DNSMASQ. The main function of Smartdns is focused on DNS resolution enhancement, the difference are:  
    * Multiple upstream server concurrent requests, after the results are measured, return the best results;
    * `address`, `ipset` domain name matching uses efficient algorithms, query matching is faster and more efficient, and router devices are still efficient.
    * Domain name matching supports ignoring specific domain names, and can be individually matched to IPv4, IPV6, and supports diversified customization.
    * Enhance the ad blocking feature, return SOA record, this block ads better;
    * IPV4, IPV6 dual stack IP optimization mechanism, in the case of dual network, choose the fastest network.
    * Supports the latest TLS, HTTPS protocol and provides secure DNS query capabilities.
    * DNS anti-poison mechanism, and a variety of mechanisms to avoid DNS pollution.
    * ECS support, the query results are better and more accurate.
    * IP blacklist support, ignoring the blacklist IP to make domain name queries better and more accurate.
    * Domain name pre-fetch, more faster to access popular websites.
    * Domain name TTL can be specified to make access faster.
    * Cache mechanism to make access faster.
    * Asynchronous log, audit log mechanism, does not affect DNS query performance while recording information.
    * Domain group mechanism, specific domain names use specific upstream server group queries to avoid privacy leakage.
    * The second DNS supports customizing more behavior.

1. What is the best practices for upstream server configuration?  
    Smartdns has a speed measurement mechanism. When configuring an upstream server, it is recommended to configure multiple upstream DNS servers, including servers in different regions, but the total number is recommended to be around 10. Recommended configuration
    * Carrier DNS.
    * Public DNS, such as `8.8.8.8`, `8.8.4.4`, `1.1.1.1`.

    For specific domain names, if there is a pollution, you can enable the anti-pollution mechanism.

1. How to enable the audit log  
    The audit log records the domain name requested by the client. The record information includes the request time, the request IP address, the request domain name, and the request type. If you want to enable the audit log, configure `audit-enable yes` in the configuration file, `audit-size`, `Audit-file`, `audit-num` configure the audit log file size, the audit log file path, and the number of audit log files. The audit log file will be compressed to save space.

1. How to avoid DNS privacy leaks  
    By default, smartdns will send requests to all configured DNS servers. If the upstream DNS servers record DNS logs, it will result in a DNS privacy leak. To avoid privacy leaks, try the following steps:
    * Use trusted DNS servers.
    * Use TLS servers.
    * Set up an upstream DNS server group.

1. How to block ads  
    Smartdns has a high-performance domain name matching algorithm. It is very efficient to filter advertisements by domain name. To block ads, you only need to configure records like the following configure. For example, if you block `*.ad.com`, configure as follows:

    ```sh
    Address /ad.com/#
    ```

    The suffix mode of the domain name, filtering *.ad.com, `#` means returning SOA record. If you want to only block IPV4 or IPV6 separately, add a number after `#`, such as `#4` is for IPV4 blocking. If you want to ignore some specific subdomains, you can configure it as follows. e.g., if you ignore `pass.ad.com`, you can configure it as follows:

    ```sh
    Address /pass.ad.com/-
    ```

1. DNS query diversion  
    In some cases, some domain names need to be queried using a specific DNS server to do DNS diversion. such as.

    ```sh
    .home -> 192.168.1.1
    .office -> 10.0.0.1
    ```

    The domain name ending in .home is sent to 192.168.1.1 for resolving
    The domain name ending in .office is sent to 10.0.0.1 for resolving
    Other domain names are resolved using the default mode.
    The diversion configuration for this case is as follows:

    ```sh
    # Upstream configuration, use -group to specify the group name, and -exclude-default-group to exclude the server from the default group.
    Server 192.168.1.1 -group home -exclude-default-group
    Server 10.0.0.1 -group office -exclude-default-group
    Server 8.8.8.8

    #Configure the resolved domain name with specific group
    Nameserver /.home/home
    Nameserver /.office/office
    ```

    You can use the above configuration to implement DNS resolution and offload. If you need to implement traffic distribution on the requesting port, you can configure the second DNS server. The bind configuration is added. The group parameter specifies the traffic distribution name.

    ```sh
    Bind :7053 -group office
    Bind :8053 -group home
    ```

1. How to use the IPV4, IPV6 dual stack IP optimization feature  
    At present, IPV6 network is not as fast as IPV4 in some cases. In order to get a better experience in the dual-stack network, SmartDNS provides a dual-stack IP optimization mechanism, the same domain name, and the speed of IPV4. Far faster than IPV6, then SmartDNS will block the resolution of IPV6, let the PC use IPV4, the feature is enabled by `dualstack-ip-selection yes`, `dualstack-ip-selection-threshold [time]` is for threshold. if you want to disable IPV6 AAAA record complete, please try `force-AAAA-SOA yes`.

1. How to improve cache performace  
    Smartdns provides a domain name caching mechanism to cache the queried domain name, and the caching time is in accordance with the DNS TTL specification. To increase the cache hit rate, the following configuration can be taken:
    * Increase the number of cache records appropriately  
    Set the number of cache records by `cache-size`.
    In the case of a query with a high pressure environment and a machine with a large memory, it can be appropriately adjusted.

    * Set the minimum TTL value as appropriate  
    Set the minimum DNS TTL time to a appropriate value by `rr-ttl-min` to extend the cache time.
    It is recommended that the timeout period be set to 10 to 30 minutes to avoid then invalid domain names when domain ip changes.

    * Enable domain pre-acquisition  
    Enable pre-fetching of domain names with `prefetch-domain yes` to improve query hit rate.
    by default, Smartdns will send domain query request again before cache expire, and cache the result for the next query. Frequently accessed domain names will continue to be cached. This feature will consume more CPU when idle.

    * Cache serve expired feature  
    Enable cache serve expired feature with `serve-expired yes` to improve the cache hit rate and reduce the CPU consumption.
    This feature will return TTL = 0 to the client after the TTL timeout, and send a new query request again at the same time, and cache the new results for later query.

1. How does the second DNS customize more behavior?  
    The second DNS can be used as the upstream of other DNS servers to provide more query behaviors. Bind configuration support can bind multiple ports. Different ports can be set with different flags to implement different functions, such as

    ```sh
    # Binding 6053 port, request for port 6053 will be configured with the upstream query of the office group, and the result will not be measured. The address configuration address is ignored.
    bind [::]:6053 -no-speed-check -group office -no-rule-addr
    ```

1. How to get SPKI of DOT  
    The SPKI can be obtained from the page published by the DNS service provider. If it is not published, it can be obtained by the following command, replace IP with your own IP.

    ```sh
    echo | openssl s_client -connect '1.0.0.1:853' 2>/dev/null | openssl x509 -pubkey -noout | openssl pkey -pubin -outform der | openssl dgst -sha256 -binary | openssl enc -base64
    ```

1. How to solve the problem of slow DNS resolution in iOS system?    
    Since iOS14, Apple has supported the resolution of DNS HTTPS (TYPE65) records. This function is used for solving problems related to HTTPS connections, but it is still a draft, and it will cause some functions such as adblocking fail. It is recommended to disable it through the following configuration.

    ```sh
    force-qtype-SOA 65
    ```

1. How to resolve localhost ip by hostname?  
    smartdns can cooperate with the dhcp server of DNSMASQ to support the resolution of local host name to IP address. You can configure smartdns to read the lease file of dnsmasq and support the resolution. The specific configuration parameters are as follows, (note that the DNSMASQ lease file may be different for each system and needs to be configured according to the actual situation)

    ```sh
    dnsmasq-lease-file /var/lib/misc/dnsmasq.leases
    ```

    After the configuration is complete, you can directly use the host name to connect to the local machine. But need to pay attention:

    * Windows system uses mDNS to resolve addresses by default. If you need to use smartdns to resolve addresses under Windows, you need to add `.` after the host name, indicating that DNS resolution is used. Such as `ping smartdns.`

1. How to use the domain set?  
    To facilitate configuring domain names by set, for configurations with /domain/, you can specify a domain name set for easy maintenance. The specific method is:
    
    * Use `domain-set` configuration domain set file:
    
    ````sh
    domain-set -name ad -file /etc/smartdns/ad-list.conf
    ````

    The format of ad-list.conf is one domain per line:
    
    ````
    ad.com
    site.com
    ````

    * To use the domain set, you only need to configure `/domain/` to `/domain-set:[collection name]/`, such as:

    ````sh
    address /domain-set:ad/#
    domain-rules /domain-set:ad/ -a #
    nameserver /domain-set:ad/server
    ...
    ````
